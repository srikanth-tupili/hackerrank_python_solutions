# Question

"""
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print "Weird".
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird".
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird". Â  
If n is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird"
